## Overview
HTML Structure: 
I structured the main content within a div classed as qr-container, which includes a nested div   with the class qr-card. This card contains an image of the QR code, a heading, and a paragraph that explains the QR code's purpose.

Styling: 
I utilized external stylesheets for the layout and styling, and incorporated Google Fonts for improved typography.

Responsiveness: 
I ensured the component is adaptable to various device widths using the meta viewport tag.

Attribution: 
The page includes an attribution section that links to Frontend Mentor and credits me, Aryan Dhir, as the coder.

This project serves as an excellent practice tool for beginners aiming to improve their HTML and CSS skills by creating a visually appealing and functional web component.

### What I learned

Throughout the development of the QR code component, I gained valuable insights and improved my skills in several areas. Here are some highlights and code snippets that I'm particularly proud of:


- ### HTML: Semantic Structure
I focused on creating a clean and semantic HTML structure. This not only helps with SEO but also makes the code easier to read and maintain. Here's an example of how I structured the main component:
'''<div class="qr-container">
  <div class="qr-card">
    <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code" class="qr-image">
    <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
    <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </div>
</div>'''

- #### CSS: Responsive Design
I applied CSS techniques to ensure the component is responsive and looks good on any device. Using Flexbox helped me manage layout adjustments dynamically. Here's a snippet that I'm proud of, which ensures the text and image are aligned beautifully:

'''.qr-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

.qr-card {
  background: white;
  padding: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  text-align: center;
}'''


### Continued development

I'm planning to build a few more cool projects before I dive into creating my portfolio website. I've realized that having a diverse set of projects to show off can really make my portfolio stand out. But, I've got to admit, sometimes my creativity gets the best of me and I end up making things more complicated than they need to be! ðŸ˜…

So, I'm working on keeping things simple and focusing more on making my designs user-friendly rather than just fancy. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m looking to sharpen up:
- **Responsive Design**: I want to get even better at making sites look great on any device, diving deeper into CSS tricks and layouts.
- **JavaScript Skills**: Iâ€™m aiming to boost my JavaScript game, maybe even get into frameworks like React to spice up my projects.
- **Performance Optimization**: As I add more to my portfolio, I need to keep those loading times quick and the performance smooth.
- **User-Centered Design**: Iâ€™m also brushing up on UX/UI principles to make sure my projects arenâ€™t just cool but also easy and enjoyable to use.

By focusing on these areas, I hope to smooth out the bumps on the road to building an awesome portfolio. Here's to making things simpler and learning loads along the way!
